 * When someone calls {#startGame} method game context moves to PLAY state and cannot move back to initial state. In
 * it dedicated thread is periodically checking what's going on with the game, stopping it entirely if necessary(for
 * example players fail to respond under given time limit). From PLAY game state can move to STOP.
 * From PAUSE it's possible to come back to PLAY, however once STOP there's no coming back.
